# Schöneberg Alert

Schöneberg Alert is a digital community pinboard for the neighborhood of Schöneberg, Berlin. It is common that such community pinboards are placed at the entrace of local supermarkets, where the local authorities and inhabitants alike may post announcements, ads or requests. I decided to create a digital version for it and givit the eyecatching name of "Schöneberg Alert" inspired by the name of sensionalist tabloids newspapers. Schöneberg residents are welcome to sign up and either post an "Alert" or comment on one. My idea is the digitazation of German society at large.
